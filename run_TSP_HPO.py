Task: Given an edge distance matrix and a local optimal route, please help me design a strategy to update the distance matrix to avoid being trapped in the local optimum with the final goal of finding a tour with minimized distance (TSP problem).
You should create an algorithm for me to update the edge distance matrix.
Provide the Python code for the new strategy. The code is a Python class that should contain two functions an "__init__()" function containing any hyper-parameters that can be optimmized, and a 
function called 'update_edge_distance(self, edge_distance, local_opt_tour, edge_n_used)' that takes three inputs, and outputs the 'updated_edge_distance', 
where 'local_opt_tour' includes the local optimal tour of IDs, 'edge_distance' and 'edge_n_used' are matrixes, 'edge_n_used' includes the number of each edge used during permutation. 
All are Numpy arrays. 
The novel function should be sufficiently complex in order to achieve better performance. It is important to ensure self-consistency.

An example heuristic to show the structure is as follows.
```python
import numpy as np

class Sample:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2

    def update_edge_distance(self, edge_distance, local_opt_tour, edge_n_used):
        # code here
        return updated_edge_distance
```

In addition, any hyper-parameters the algorithm used will be optimized by SMAC, for this, provide a Configuration space as Python dictionary (without the edge_distance, local_opt_tour, edge_n_used parameters) and include all hyper-parameters to be optimized in the __init__ function header.
An example configuration space is as follows:

```python
{
    "float_parameter": (0.1, 1.5),
    "int_parameter": (2, 10), 
    "categoral_parameter": ["mouse", "cat", "dog"]
}
```

Give an excellent and novel heuristic including its configuration space to solve this task and also give it a name. Give the response in the format:
# Name: <name>
# Code: <code>
# Space: <configuration_space>
"""
