Your task is to write the optimization algorithm in Python code. The code should contain an `__init__(self, budget, dim)` function and the function `def __call__(self, func)`, which should optimize the black box function `func` using `self.budget` function evaluations.\nThe func() can only be called as many times as the budget allows, not more. Each of the optimization functions has a search space between -5.0 (lower bound) and 5.0 (upper bound). The dimensionality can be varied.\nGive an excellent and novel heuristic algorithm to solve this task and also give it a one-line description with the main idea.\n\nThe current population of algorithms already evaluated (name, description, score) is:\nHybridSwarmOptimization: Hybrid Swarm Optimization with adaptive diversity preservation and local intensification to enhance exploitation.
