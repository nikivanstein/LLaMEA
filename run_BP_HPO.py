I need help designing a novel score function that scoring a set of bins to assign an item.
In each step, the item will be assigned to the bin with the maximum score. If the rest capacity of a bin equals the maximum capacity, it will not be used. The final goal is to minimize the number of used bins.

The heuristic algorithm class should contain two functions an "__init__()" function containing any hyper-parameters that can be optimmized, and a "score(self, item, bins)" function, which gives back the 'scores'.
'item' and 'bins' are the size of the current item and the rest capacities of feasible bins, which are larger than the item size.
The output named 'scores' is the scores for the bins for assignment.
Note that 'item' is of type int, while 'bins' and 'scores' are both Numpy arrays. The novel function should be sufficiently complex in order to achieve better performance. It is important to ensure self-consistency.

An example heuristic to show the structure is as follows.
```python
import numpy as np

class Sample:
    def __init__(self, param1, param2):
        self.param1 = param1
        self.param2 = param2

    def score(self, item, bins):
        scores = item - bins
        return scores
```

In addition, any hyper-parameters the algorithm uses will be optimized by SMAC, for this, provide a Configuration space as Python dictionary (without the item and bins parameters) and include all hyper-parameters to be optimized in the __init__ function header.
An example configuration space is as follows:

```python
{
    "float_parameter": (0.1, 1.5),
    "int_parameter": (2, 10), 
    "categoral_parameter": ["mouse", "cat", "dog"]
}
```

Give an excellent and novel heuristic including its configuration space to solve this task and also give it a name. Give the response in the format:
# Name: <name>
# Code: <code>
# Space: <configuration_space>
"""

    f"Try a completely new strategy that you have not tried before (and give it a distinct name). Give the response in the format:\n"
